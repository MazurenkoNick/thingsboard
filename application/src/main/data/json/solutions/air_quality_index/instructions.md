## Solution instructions

Welcome to your new **Air Quality Monitoring** solution 👋 We have generated two robust dashboards (Public & Administration) for you. Use this solution to:

* **Monitor** real-time Air Quality Index (AQI) and specific pollutants;
* **Visualize** city-wide pollution levels on an interactive map;
* **Manage** sensor health, battery levels, and connectivity alarms;
* **Inform** the public with automated health recommendations.

### 🖥 Mastering the dashboards

This solution includes two distinct interfaces: one for the **Public** (End Users) and one for **Tenant Administrators**.

#### 🌍 Public Air Quality Monitoring Dashboard 

This dashboard is designed for end-users and requires no login. It is pre-configured to monitor **Los Angeles** and operates in two main views within the same interface.
The dashboard layout consists of an interactive map on the right and a dynamic information sidebar on the left.

**1. City State (Aggregate View)**

This view represents the overall air pollution monitoring of the specific city. It calculates values based on data received from all city sensors.

<div class="img-float" style="max-width:50%; margin: 10px auto">
<img src="https://img.thingsboard.io/solutions/air_quality_index/instruction-city-state.png" alt="AQI Public Dashboard - City State">
</div>

* **City Details:** Displays the name of the current city (Los Angeles) along with real-time "Temperature" and "Humidity".
* **Pollution Status:** Shows the current status according to "EPA standards" (e.g., "Clean", "Unhealthy").
* **AQI Scale:** Displays the average "AQI value" based on all sensors in the city, visualized on a color-coded scale for convenient viewing.
* **Legend Info:** Click the ℹ️ "info-icon" under the AQI value to open a pop-up with the full legend of pollutants.
* **Recommendations:** A dedicated section provides general recommendations for sensitive groups of people regarding the current level of pollution.
* **History:** A chart displaying the AQI level trends in the **Live**, **weekly**, and **monthly** range.
* **Interactive Map:** Shows air pollution monitoring stations across the city. The markers are **color-coded** depending on their specific AQI level.

**Interaction:** Click on any sensor marker on the map to **instantly update the dashboard** with data for that specific district (Sensor State). You can switch between districts by clicking different markers.

<br>

**2. Sensor State (District View)**

When a marker is selected (e.g., Beverly Hills), the sidebar updates to show the local state of that specific district.

* **Local Data:** Displays the same metrics as the City state (Temperature🌡️, Humidity 💧, Recommendations), but the values are specific to the selected sensor.
* **Specific Pollutants:** A dedicated section of tiles displaying values for **PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO, SO2,** and **O3** 🧪.
    * *Pop-ups:* Click on any tile to view a description, specific recommendations, and statistics for that pollutant.

#### 🛠️ Air Quality Monitoring Administration Dashboard

This <a href="${Air Quality Monitoring AdministrationDASHBOARD_URL}" target="_blank">**dashboard**</a> is designed for tenant administrators to oversee the entire sensor fleet. It allows you to add new devices, monitor technical health (battery, connectivity), and configure alarm rules.

**1. Main State**

The central hub for device management, divided into three key areas:

* **Sensors List:** a comprehensive table displaying the technical status of every device.
    * **Columns:** Quickly check the "Sensor Label", "Connection" status (Connected/Disconnected), "Battery level", and "Last AQI" reading.
    * **Actions:** Use the icons on the right to "Edit" ✏️ or "Delete" 🗑️ sensors. You can also provision new devices using the "+" table header button.
* **Alarms Console:** a real-time log of all active and cleared alerts across the system.
    * **Data:** Shows the "Created time", "Type" of alarm (e.g., Low Battery Level, Inactive), "Sensor id" and current alarm "Status".
    * **Configuration:** Click the settings icon ⚙️ "Alarm rules" in the header to configure global thresholds, such as the minimum **Battery Level %** or the timeout duration for **Connection Loss**.
* **Interactive Map:** visualizes the physical location and status of your AQI sensors.
    * **Actions:** Click the "+ Add sensor" button at the top of the map to provision a new device and place it in the map.
    * **Markers:** Color-coded based on the sensor's real-time status: 
      * **🔴 Red:** Has active alarms (Critical state).
      * **🟢 Green:** Normal state (Healthy and reporting data).
      * **⚪ Gray:** No data available (Sensor has not reported AQI or Battery level yet).
    * **Pop-ups:** Click any marker to see a summary card with the Sensor ID, Battery, and Last AQI. Click the "Details" link to drill down into that specific sensor details state.

### 📚 Examples & Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Triggering a Low Battery Alarm 🔋

**Goal:** Verify the alarm system by simulating a critical battery drop on Air Quality Sensor 1 (Hollywood). Current battery level value: 43.73%

<br>

<div class="img-float" style="max-width: 60%;margin:auto">
<img src="https://img.thingsboard.io/solutions/air_quality_index/use-case-sensor-1-1.png" alt="">
</div>

<br>

**1. Configure Threshold:** First, let's make the rule stricter. Go to the Admin Dashboard, click the settings ⚙️ icon "Alarm rules" in the Alarms section. Set the Battery Level threshold to 10% and click Save.

<br>

<div class="img-float" style="max-width: 60%;margin:auto">
<img src="https://img.thingsboard.io/solutions/air_quality_index/use-case-sensor-1-2.png" alt="">
</div>

<div class="img-float" style="max-width: fit-content;margin:auto">
<img src="https://img.thingsboard.io/solutions/air_quality_index/use-case-sensor-1-3.png" alt="">
</div>

<br>

**2. The Action:** Simulate a battery level of 9% (below the new limit) using this command:

```bash
curl -v -X POST -d "{\"batteryLevel\": 9 }" ${BASE_URL}/api/v1/${Air Quality Sensor 1ACCESS_TOKEN}/telemetry --header "Content-Type:application/json"{:copy-code}
```

<br>

**3. Result:** The system detects the value (9%) is lower than the limit (10%) and triggers a Low Battery Alarm. You will see this appear in the Alarms Console and on the Map.

<br>

<div class="img-float" style="max-width: 60%;margin:auto">
<img src="https://img.thingsboard.io/solutions/air_quality_index/use-case-sensor-1-4.png" alt="">
</div>


##### Scenario 2: Reporting Hazardous Air Quality 😷

**Goal:** Simulate a dangerous pollution event using PM2.5 data on Air Quality Sensor 2 (Downtown).

**1. Current State:** The sensor currently reports a moderate level (e.g., PM 2.5 in AQI equivalent is 52).

<div class="img-float" style="max-width: 60%;margin:10px auto">
<img src="https://img.thingsboard.io/solutions/air_quality_index/use-case-sensor-2-1.png" alt="">
</div>

<br>

**2. The Action:** Simulate a massive spike in PM2.5 to 400 μg/m³ (a Hazardous level):

```bash
curl -v -X POST -d "{\"pm25\": 400 }" ${BASE_URL}/api/v1/${Air Quality Sensor 2ACCESS_TOKEN}/telemetry --header "Content-Type:application/json"{:copy-code}
```

<br>

**3. Result:** The Calculated Fields logic processes the PM2.5 reading, computes a new AQI of 433, and instantly updates the dashboard status to "Hazardous" (Purple).

<br>

### 📡 Edge computing

**Optionally**, this solution can be extended to use edge computing.

<a href="https://thingsboard.io/products/thingsboard-edge/" target="_blank">ThingsBoard Edge</a> allows bringing data analysis and management to the edge, where the data created.
At the same time ThingsBoard Edge seamlessly synchronizing with the ThingsBoard cloud according to your business needs.

As example, in the context of Air Quality Monitoring solution, edge computing could be useful if you have cities that are scattered throughout the country.
In this case, ThingsBoard Edge can be deployed into every city (remote location) to process data from sensors and other devices, calculation of AQI, enabling real-time analysis and decision-making, such as generating alarms in case pollution level is violated. 
Edge is going to process data in case there is no network connection to the central ThingsBoard server, and thus no data will be lost and required decisions are going to be taken locally. 
Eventually, required data is going to be pushed to the cloud, once network connection is established. 
Configuration of edge computing business logic is centralized in a single place - ThingsBoard server.

In the scope of this solution, new edge entity <a href="${Remote Location R1EDGE_DETAILS_URL}" target="_blank">Remote Location R1</a> was created.

Additionally, particular entity groups were already assigned to the edge entity to simplify the edge deployment:

* **"AQI City"** *ASSET* group;
* **"AQI Sensor"** *DEVICE* group;
* **"Air Quality Monitoring"** *DASHBOARD* group.
* **"Air Quality Monitoring Public"** *DASHBOARD* group.

To install ThingsBoard Edge and connect to the cloud, please navigate to <a href="${Remote Location R1EDGE_DETAILS_URL}" target="_blank">edge details page</a> and click **Install & Connect instructions** button.

Once the edge is installed and connected to the cloud, you will be able to log in into edge using your tenant credentials.

#### 🔄 Push data to device on edge

**"AQI Sensor"** *DEVICE* group was assigned to the edge entity "Remote Location R1".
This means that all devices from this group will be automatically provisioned to the edge.

You can see devices from this group once you log in into edge and navigate to the **Entities -> Devices** page.

To emulate the data upload on behalf of device "Air Quality Sensor 1" to the edge, one should execute the following command:

```bash
curl -v -X POST -d "{\"temperature\":  42, \"humidity\":  73, \"pm25\":  24.4, \"pm10\":  30, \"no2\":  13, \"co\":  2.8, \"so2\":  7, \"o3\":  0.164, \"batteryLevel\":  77 }" http://localhost:8080/api/v1/${Air Quality Sensor 1ACCESS_TOKEN}/telemetry --header "Content-Type:application/json"{:copy-code}
```

Or please use next command if you updated edge HTTP 8080 bind port to **18080** during edge installation:

```bash
curl -v -X POST -d "{\"temperature\":  42, \"humidity\":  73, \"pm25\":  24.4, \"pm10\":  30, \"no2\":  13, \"co\":  2.8, \"so2\":  7, \"o3\":  0.164, \"batteryLevel\":  77 }" http://localhost:18080/api/v1/${Air Quality Sensor 1ACCESS_TOKEN}/telemetry --header "Content-Type:application/json"{:copy-code}
```

Once you'll push data to the device "Air Quality Sensor 1" on edge, you'll be able to see telemetry update on the cloud for this device as well.
