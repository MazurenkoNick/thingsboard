## Solution instructions

Welcome to your new **Water Metering** solution! 👋
This template is a complete Smart Utility platform designed for municipalities, sub-metering companies, and building managers. Use this solution to:

* 💧 **Monitor** real-time water consumption and detect anomalies;
* 🗺️ **Visualize** your entire meter network on an interactive, clustered map;
* 🚨 **Detect** leaks, pipe bursts, and freezing conditions instantly;
* 👥 **Manage** customers and automate sub-metering data collection.

### 🖥 Mastering the dashboards

This solution includes two distinct interfaces:
**1.**  <a href="${MAIN_DASHBOARD_URL}" target="_blank">**Water Metering Tenant Dashboard:**</a> For the utility provider to manage the entire metering infrastructure and customer base.
**2.  Water Metering User Dashboard:** A simplified view for end-users to monitor their own water usage.

You may always customize dashboards using dashboard development <a href="${DOCS_BASE_URL}/user-guide/dashboards/" target="_blank">guide</a>.

#### 🛠️ Water Metering Tenant Dashboard

This interface allows you to manage the entire hierarchy: from the physical meter to the end-user customer. It is organized into six key tabs.

**1. Total (Overview)**
The default landing page designed for a high-level operational summary.
* **📊 KPI Cards:** Instant metrics for "Consumed per current week", "Active devices", "Low battery", and "Inactive devices".
* **🗺️ Interactive Map:**
  * **Clustering:** Markers are grouped to handle thousands of meters.
  * **Quick Add:** Use the "+ Add water meter" button directly on the map to provision new water meters.
* **📋 Water Meters:** A quick-access table on the right side showing the most relevant device data.
  * **Columns:** Check "Serial Number", "Latest reading", "Status", and "Battery level" at a glance.
  * **Actions:** Add new sensors via the widget header "+" button. Also, click on "row" will navigate you to specific **water meter details** state.
* **📉 Consumption & Alerts:** A split view showing a "Water Consumption" bar chart (Daily/Weekly) and a list of "Active Alarms" for immediate attention.

**2. 📊 Analytics**
Navigate here for deep-dive consumption analysis.

* **📈 Consumption Chart:** A detailed line graph comparing water usage over time (Current vs. Previous interval), helping you identify trends.

**3. Devices**
Navigate to the **"Devices"** tab to manage your physical sensors.

* **🛠️ Water Meters:** A comprehensive table managing your entire metering network.
  * **Columns:** View "Serial Number", "Latest Reading", "Address", "Status", and "Leakage" status (🟢 **Green** dot means that there is no leak).
  * **Actions:** Use the widget header button "+" to add new meters. Use row buttons to "Edit" ✏️, "Locate" 📍, or "Delete" 🗑️ water meters. As usual, click on "row" will navigate you to specific **water meter details** state.
  * **Assignment:** Click the **Edit** ✏️ button on any row to change the **Device Owner**. This allows you to re-assign a meter from the Tenant (Stock) to a specific Customer (Rental/Lease) instantly.
* **🚨 Active Alarms:** A list showing active alarms for all sensors.

**4. 👥 Customers**
This solution supports a **Supplier/Rental model**. As a Tenant Admin, you own the meters but can assign them to customers and unassign them by changing ownership.

* **➕ Onboard Customers:** Click the "+" button to create a new customer. This **automatically creates a user account**, under newly created customer, allowing the customer to log in to their personal dashboard immediately.
* **📦 Manage Inventory:** Click on any customer row to **drill down** into their specific state. This opens a view showing only the devices currently assigned to that customer.
* **🚛 Provisioning:** While inside a customer's view, you can create a new device to provision a meter straight from the warehouse directly to that customer's account.

**5. 🚨 Alarms**

A dedicated console for operational health and maintenance allow you
to track critical issues like "Daily/Weekly Consumption Threshold Exceeded"
or "Leakage Detected" or "Device Inactive" etc., across all devices.

**6. ⚙️ Settings**
Configure the business logic of your solution without coding.

* **🚨 System Alarms:** Toggle global alerts for "Low Battery", "Low Temperature", "Inactivity" and "Daily/Weekly Consumption Threshold Exceeded".
  * **📏 Thresholds:** Set specific limits (e.g., "Max Daily Consumption = 100") to trigger alerts depends on your sensor limits or business logic.
* **📨 Notifications:** Enable SMS or Email routing for specific alarm types.


#### 👤 Water Metering User Dashboard

When a Customer User logs in, they are presented with a **full-screen dashboard** that is visually similar to the Tenant view but with restricted permissions and data scoped strictly to their assigned devices.

**Key Differences:**

**1. Total (Customer View)**
* **📊 Simplified KPIs:** Focuses purely on consumption metrics (e.g., "Consumed per day", "Consumed per current week") relevant to their bill, rather than the operational health metrics seen by the Admin.
* **🔒 Read-Only Map:** Shows only the meters owned by the customer. Crucially, the "+ Add water meter" button is removed.

**2. 📉 Analytics**
* **Personal Tracking:** Users can compare their current usage against previous periods to track their own efficiency.

**3. Devices (Read-Only)**
* **🔒 Inventory:** Users can view their list of meters and check status/consumption, but the add "+" and delete 🗑 buttons are removed.
* **Actions:** Row actions are limited to "Edit" ✏️ (change label) and "Locate" 📍.

**4. ⚙️ Settings (Restricted)**
Customers can configure alerts relevant to their property usage, but technical device health settings (managed by the Tenant) are hidden.

* **✅ Visible Settings:** Customers **can** toggle alarms and modify the specific thresholds for "Low Temperature" (Freeze risk), "Daily Consumption", and "Weekly Consumption".
* **❌ Technical Alarms:** Alarms related to device health (e.g., "Low Battery", "Inactivity") are not applicable to the Customer, as maintenance is handled entirely by the Tenant.
* **📨 Notifications:** Customers can toggle SMS or Email notifications, but only for the specific alarms visible to them (Temperature and Consumption).

### 🔌 Devices

We have pre-provisioned **3 Water Meters** and loaded them with demo data. See the device info and credentials below:

<div class="tb-markdown-view table-wrapper">

${device_list_and_credentials}

</div>

Solution expects that the water meter device will report `pulseCounter`, `temperature`, `battery` and `leakage` values.
The most simple example of the expected payload is in JSON format:

```json
{"pulseCounter":  550, "temperature":  22.0, "battery":  97, "leakage":  false}{:copy-code}
```

#### ⚡ Test it now

To emulate the data upload on behalf of device "WM0000123", one should execute the following command:

```bash
curl -v -X POST -d "{\"pulseCounter\":  550, \"temperature\":  22.0, \"battery\":  97, \"leakage\":  false}" ${BASE_URL}/api/v1/${WM0000123ACCESS_TOKEN}/telemetry --header "Content-Type:application/json"{:copy-code}
```

The example above uses <a href="${DOCS_BASE_URL}/reference/http-api/#telemetry-upload-api" target="_blank">HTTP API</a>.
See <a href="${DOCS_BASE_URL}/getting-started-guides/connectivity/" target="_blank">connecting devices</a> for other connectivity options.

Most of the water meters are using LoRaWAN, Sigfox or NB IoT technology. Please check <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/integrations/" target="_blank">ThingsBoard Integrations</a> for more info.

### 🚨 Alarms

Alarms are generated based on <a href="${DOCS_BASE_URL}/user-guide/alarm-rules" target="_blank">Alarm rules</a> configured in the "Water Meter" device profile and thresholds set in the Dashboard Settings.

<div class="tb-markdown-view table-wrapper">

${alarm_rules}

</div>

### 🧮 Calculated fields

Calculated fields are used to derive daily and weekly water consumption metrics and analytical indicators based on incoming telemetry.

The aggregation is done in the UTC time zone by default. You may configure settings like the time zone or interval duration in Calculated fields.

<div class="tb-markdown-view table-wrapper">

${calculated_fields}

</div>

### 🧠 Rule Chains

The system includes intelligent processing logic:

* **Water Metering Solution Main:** Processes incoming telemetry and route alarm action messages for notifications.

* **Alarm Routing:** Two distinct chains (Tenant and Customer) ensure the right person gets the alert. 
  * **Water Metering Solution Tenant Alarm Routing:** Responsible for sending notifications to the Tenant Administrator. It routes all system alarms, including "Leakage Detected", "Device Inactive", "Low Battery", "Low Temperature", and Consumption Thresholds.
  * **Water Metering Solution Customer Alarm Routing:** Responsible for sending notifications to the Customer User. It routes only personal usage alarms: "Daily Consumption", "Weekly Consumption", and "Low Temperature".

### 👥 Customers and Users

We have pre-created two customers to demonstrate the multi-customer capabilities:

* **Water Metering Customer A:** Assigned devices "WM0000123" and "WM0000124".

* **Water Metering Customer B:** Assigned device "WM0000125".

Each customer has a dedicated User account automatically created for them, with the "Water Metering User Dashboard" shared with them by default. 
You may create more Customers and Users directly via the <a href="${MAIN_DASHBOARD_URL}" target="_blank">"Water Metering Tenant Dashboard"</a>.

<div class="tb-markdown-view table-wrapper">

</div>

### 📡 Edge computing

**Optionally**, this solution can be extended to use edge computing.

<a href="https://thingsboard.io/products/thingsboard-edge/" target="_blank">ThingsBoard Edge</a> allows bringing data analysis and management to the edge, where the data created.
At the same time ThingsBoard Edge seamlessly synchronizes with the ThingsBoard cloud according to your business needs.

As example, in the context of Water metering solution, edge computing could be useful if you have remote facilities that are located in different parts of town, country or worldwide.
In this case, ThingsBoard Edge can be deployed into every remote facility to process data from water meters, calculating daily consumption, enabling real-time analysis and decision-making, such as alarm generation in case no data from sensors after X hours. 
Edge is going to process data in case there is no network connection to the central ThingsBoard server, and thus no data will be lost and required decisions are going to be taken locally. 
Eventually, required data is going to be pushed to the cloud, once network connection is established. 
Configuration of edge computing business logic is centralized in a single place - ThingsBoard server.

In the scope of this solution, new edge entity <a href="${Remote Facility W1EDGE_DETAILS_URL}" target="_blank">Remote Facility W1</a> was added to a customer "Water Metering Customer A".

Additionally, particular entity groups were already assigned to the edge entity to simplify the edge deployment:

* **"Customer Administrators"** *USER* group of customer "Water Metering Customer A";
* **"Water Meters"** *DEVICE* group of customer "Water Metering Customer A";
* **"Water Metering"** *DASHBOARD* group of your tenant.
* **"Water Metering Shared"** *DASHBOARD* group of your tenant.

To install ThingsBoard Edge and connect to the cloud, please navigate to <a href="${Remote Facility W1EDGE_DETAILS_URL}" target="_blank">edge details page</a> and click **Install & Connect instructions** button.

Once the edge is installed and connected to the cloud, you will be able to log in into edge using your tenant or users of customer "Water Metering Customer A" credentials.

#### 🔄 Push data to device on edge

**"Water Meters"** *DEVICE* group of customer "Water Metering Customer A" was assigned to the edge entity "Remote Facility W1".
This means that all devices from this group will be automatically provisioned to the edge.

You can see devices from this group once you log in into edge and navigate to the **Entities -> Devices** page.

To emulate the data upload on behalf of device "WM0000123" to the edge, one should execute the following command:

```bash
curl -v -X POST -d "{\"pulseCounter\":  550, \"temperature\":  22.0, \"battery\":  97, \"leakage\":  false}" http://localhost:8080/api/v1/${WM0000123ACCESS_TOKEN}/telemetry --header "Content-Type:application/json"{:copy-code}
```

<br>

Or please use next command if you updated edge HTTP 8080 bind port to **18080** during edge installation:

```bash
curl -v -X POST -d "{\"pulseCounter\":  550, \"temperature\":  22.0, \"battery\":  97, \"leakage\":  false}" http://localhost:18080/api/v1/${WM0000123ACCESS_TOKEN}/telemetry --header "Content-Type:application/json"{:copy-code}
```

<br>

Once you'll push data to the device "WM0000123" on edge, you'll be able to see telemetry update on the cloud for this device as well.
