## Solution instructions

Welcome to your new **Assisted Living** solution! 👋
We have generated the <a href="${MAIN_DASHBOARD_URL}" target="_blank">"Assisted Living Administration"</a> dashboard for you.
This dashboard is designed for monitoring the health and safety of residents using BLE/LoRa wearables and environmental sensors. Use this solution to:

* 🏥 **Monitor** residents' vital signs (Heart Rate, Temperature) in real-time;
* 📍 **Track** resident locations via BLE beacons and gateways;
* 🚨 **Detect** critical events like falls (Panic Button), smoke, or open doors;
* 🗺️ **Manage** facility layout, zones, and device assignments.

The solution is built on **BLE or LoRa gateways and devices**. Key technical features include:

* **🏠 Room Sensors:** Rooms may be equipped with sensors like room temperature, humidity, indoor air quality (IAQ), leak, smoke, and open/close detectors.
* **🛰️ Geopositioning:** Resident tracking is done via the beacon in the wristband and a set of nearby gateways.
* **🔄 Data Processing:** The platform deduplicates incoming messages from beacons and enriches them with the attributes of nearby gateways.
* **🧠 Algorithm:** The location logic is based on the payload's **RSSI parameter**. One may improve the algorithm based on the particular use case.

### 🚨 Alarms

The solution uses pre-configured <a href="${DOCS_BASE_URL}/user-guide/alarm-rules" target="_blank">Alarm rules</a> assigned to device profiles.
Administrators can configure specific thresholds for **Major** and **Critical** severity levels directly from the dashboard settings (as described in the **Mastering the Dashboard** section).

#### ⌚ Resident Alarms (Wristband)

These alarms monitor the health and safety of the resident.

* **Panic Button:** Triggers a **Major** alarm on a single press and a **Critical** alarm if pressed 2 or more times.
* **Heart Rate:** Triggers if the `pulse` value falls outside the safe range (lower/upper limits).
* **Body Temperature:** Triggers if the `temperature` value falls outside the safe range.
* **High Noise:** Triggers if the `noise` level exceeds the configured decibel limit, indicating a potential fall or distress.
* **Low Battery:** Triggers if the wristband `battery` level drops below the configured percentage.

#### 🏢 Infrastructure Alarms (Room Sensors)

These alarms monitor the safety and environmental conditions of the facility.

* **Security (Door/Window):** Triggers if a `doorOpen` or `windowOpen` event lasts longer than the allowed duration.
* **Critical Hazards:** Triggers immediately if **Smoke** (`smoke` = TRUE) or a **Water Leak** (`waterLeak` = TRUE) is detected.
* **Environment:** Triggers if **Air Quality** (`roomIaq`), **Temperature** (`roomTemperature`), or **Humidity** (`roomHumidity`) breach the defined comfort ranges.
* **Sensor Battery:** Triggers if any room sensor's `battery` level drops below the configured limit.

<br>

Below is the complete list of alarm rules configured for this solution:

<div class="tb-markdown-view table-wrapper">

${alarm_rules}

</div>

### 🔌 Devices

The solution includes wearable devices and room sensors connected via gateways.

* ⌚ **Resident wristbands:** Track health vitals (Heart Rate, Temp) and location via BLE beacons.
* 🏠 **Room sensors:** Monitor environmental conditions including Temperature, Humidity, IAQ, Smoke, Water Leaks, and Door/Window status.
* 📡 **Gateways:** BLE or LoRa gateways that collect data from nearby sensors and wristbands to forward to the platform.

Each device sends telemetry that is processed by rule chains and evaluated against alarm rules.
We have already created devices and loaded some demo data for them. See device info and credentials below:

<div class="tb-markdown-view table-wrapper">

${device_list_and_credentials}

</div>

### ⛓️ Rule Chains

* **📡 AL Gateway Rule Chain:** This chain handles the core processing of data arriving from gateways: deduplication, device identification, and location enrichment.
  * **Enrichment:** The "Fetch Room attributes" node adds the gateway's location to the incoming message.
  * **Device Lookup:** The "Change Owner from Gateway to Device" node identifies the specific device (wristband or sensor) using the serial number in the payload.
  * **Routing:** The "Switch by Device Type" node directs the message to either the "Room" or "Wristband" processing chain.
  * **Location Logic:** The chain uses "Deduplicate From Multiple Gateways" to combine duplicate messages and "Use msg with Max RSSI" to pinpoint the resident's location based on the strongest signal (closest gateway).

* **⌚ AL Wristband Device Rule Chain:**
  This chain functions similarly to the default platform rule chain (saving telemetry). Uniquely, it also counts the number of active alarms and propagates this value to the corresponding resident user entity for dashboard display.

* **🏠 AL Room Device Rule Chain:**
  Very similar to the Wristband chain but dedicated to infrastructure sensors. It processes data and alarms but does not propagate alarm counts to specific user entities.

### 📚 Examples & Scenarios

#### 💓 Scenario 1: Triggering a Heart Rate Alarm

**Goal:** Simulate a critical health event where a resident's heart rate drops below the safety threshold.

**1. Context:** We will use resident "William Harris" (Current vital heart rate: 95 BPM).

<br>

<div class="img-float" style="max-width: 40%;margin: 20px auto;">
<img src="https://img.thingsboard.io/solutions/assisted_living/example-1-1.png" alt="Assisted Living">
</div>

<br>

**2. Check Rules:** By clicking the **Settings (⚙️)** icon in the Resident Alarms section, we see that a pulse lower than **60 BPM** triggers an alarm.

<br>

<div class="img-float" style="max-width: 40%;margin: 20px auto;">
<img src="https://img.thingsboard.io/solutions/assisted_living/example-1-2.png" alt="Assisted Living">
</div>

<br>

**3. Action:** Run the following command to send a telemetry update with a pulse of **55 BPM**:

```bash
curl -v -X POST -d "{\"serial\": \"C00000025FE2\", \"data\":{\"pulse\":55}}" ${BASE_URL}/api/v1/${D00000020002ACCESS_TOKEN}/telemetry --header "Content-Type:application/json"{:copy-code}
```

<br>

**Result:** The resident marker for William Harris turns Red on the map, and a new "Heart Rate" alarm appears in the active alarms list.

<br>

<div class="img-float" style="max-width: 55%;margin: 20px auto;">
<img src="https://img.thingsboard.io/solutions/assisted_living/example-1-3.png" alt="Assisted Living">
</div>

#### 🚶 Scenario 2: Tracking Resident Movement

**Goal:** Demonstrate how the system uses signal strength (RSSI) to locate a resident moving between rooms.

**1. Context:** Resident "Isabella Davis" is currently located on Floor 1.

<br>

<div class="img-float" style="max-width: 40%;margin: 20px auto;">
<img src="https://img.thingsboard.io/solutions/assisted_living/example-2-1.png" alt="Assisted Living">
</div>

<br>

**2. Logic:** The system receives signals from multiple gateways. The gateway with the highest (least negative) RSSI value determines the location.

**3. Action:** We will simulate her wristband sending signals to two gateways simultaneously:
  * **Room 103 Gateway:** RSSI -10 (Strong Signal)
  * **Room 104 Gateway:** RSSI -70 (Weak Signal)

```bash
curl -v -X POST -d "{\"serial\": \"C00000066F66\", \"rssi\": -10, \"data\":{\"batteryLevel\":55}}" ${BASE_URL}/api/v1/${D00000030003ACCESS_TOKEN}/telemetry --header "Content-Type:application/json" && curl -v -X POST -d "{\"serial\": \"C00000066F66\", \"rssi\": -70, \"data\":{\"batteryLevel\":55}}" ${BASE_URL}/api/v1/${D00000040004ACCESS_TOKEN}/telemetry --header "Content-Type:application/json" {:copy-code}
```

<br>

**Result:** The system compares the signals (-10 vs -70) and updates Isabella's location to Room 103 on the interactive map.

<br>

<div class="img-float" style="max-width: 40%;margin: 20px auto;">
<img src="https://img.thingsboard.io/solutions/assisted_living/example-2-2.png" alt="Assisted Living">
</div>

##### 🌫️ Scenario 3: Room Air Quality Alert

**Goal:** Trigger an infrastructure alarm due to poor indoor air quality (IAQ).

**1. Context:** We are monitoring Room 101, which has a normal IAQ level of 67.

<br>

<div class="img-float" style="max-width: 40%;margin: 20px auto;">
<img src="https://img.thingsboard.io/solutions/assisted_living/example-3-2.png" alt="Assisted Living">
</div>

<br>

**2. Check Rules:** In the Room Alarms settings, the threshold for a "High IAQ" alarm is set to > 150.

<br>

<div class="img-float" style="max-width: 40%;margin: 20px auto;">
<img src="https://img.thingsboard.io/solutions/assisted_living/example-3-1.png" alt="Assisted Living">
</div>

<br>

**3. Action:** Run the command below to simulate a sensor reading of 160 IAQ:

```bash
curl -v -X POST -d "{\"serial\": \"E00000015FE1\", \"rssi\": -50, \"data\":{\"IAQ\":160}}" ${BASE_URL}/api/v1/${D00000010001ACCESS_TOKEN}/telemetry --header "Content-Type:application/json" {:copy-code}
```

<br>

**Result:** Because 160 exceeds the limit of 150, a new "Air Quality" alarm is generated for Room 101, and the room's status indicator changes to warn staff.

<br>

<div class="img-float" style="max-width: 50%;margin: 20px auto;">

### 📡 Edge computing

**Optionally**, this solution can be extended to use edge computing.

<a href="https://thingsboard.io/products/thingsboard-edge/" target="_blank">ThingsBoard Edge</a> allows bringing data analysis and management to the edge, where the data created.
At the same time ThingsBoard Edge seamlessly synchronizing with the ThingsBoard cloud according to your business needs.

As example, in the context of  Assisted Living solution, edge computing could be useful if you have residences that are located in different parts of town, country or worldwide.
In this case, ThingsBoard Edge can be deployed into every residence to process data from resident sensors, enabling real-time analysis and decision-making, such as getting alarm notifications in case health status of resident become critical and calling for assistance.
Edge is going to process data in case there is no network connection to the central ThingsBoard server, and thus no data will be lost and required decisions are going to be taken locally.
Eventually, required data is going to be pushed to the cloud, once network connection is established.
Configuration of edge computing business logic is centralized in a single place - ThingsBoard server.

In the scope of this solution, new edge entity <a href="${Remote Residence R1EDGE_DETAILS_URL}" target="_blank">Remote Residence R1</a> was created.

Additionally, particular entities and entity groups were already assigned to the edge entity to simplify the edge deployment:

* **"Administrators"** *USER* group of customer "Assisted Living Company";
* **"Residents"** *USER* group of customer "Assisted Living Company";
* **"Floor 1"** asset;
* **"Floor 2"** asset;
* **"Root 101"** asset;
* **"Root 102"** asset;
* **"D00000010001"** device;
* **"D00000020002"** device;
* **"C00000015FE1"** device;
* **"C00000025FE2"** device;
* **"Assisted Living"** *DASHBOARD* group.

**NOTE**: only limited number of assets and devices were assigned to the edge due to the limitation of default edge license.

To install ThingsBoard Edge and connect to the cloud, please navigate to <a href="${Remote Residence R1EDGE_DETAILS_URL}" target="_blank">edge details page</a> and click **Install & Connect instructions** button.

Once the edge is installed and connected to the cloud, you will be able to log in into edge using your tenant credentials.

#### 🔄 Push data to device on edge

All the devices that were assigned to the edge entity "Remote Residence R1" are going to be automatically provisioned to the edge.

You can see these devices once you log in into edge and navigate to the **Entities -> Devices** page.

To emulate the data upload on behalf of resident **"William Harris"** and simulate pulse update to the edge, one should execute the following command:

```bash
curl -v -X POST -d "{\"serial\": \"C00000025FE2\", \"data\":{\"pulse\":55}}" http://localhost:8080/api/v1/${D00000020002ACCESS_TOKEN}/telemetry --header "Content-Type:application/json"{:copy-code}
```

Or please use next command if you updated edge HTTP 8080 bind port to **18080** during edge installation:

```bash
curl -v -X POST -d "{\"serial\": \"C00000025FE2\", \"data\":{\"pulse\":55}}" http://localhost:18080/api/v1/${D00000020002ACCESS_TOKEN}/telemetry --header "Content-Type:application/json"{:copy-code}
```

Once you'll push data on behalf of resident **"William Harris"** to edge, you'll be able to see alarm generated on dashboard and telemetry update on the cloud for this resident as well.
